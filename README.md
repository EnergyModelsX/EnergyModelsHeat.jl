`EnergyModelsHeat` extends `EnergyModelsBase` with functionality to model heat flows, heat pumps, thermal energy storage, and district heating networks with higher accuracy.
This includes as well an approach for the calculation of the potential for utilizing surplus heat from processes in the district heating network.

## Usage

The usage of the package is best illustrated through the commented [`examples`](examples).
The examples are minimum working examples highlighting how to build simple energy system models.
