`bioCHP_plant` is a c++ module within  `EnergyModelsHeat` with functionality to model mass and energy flows, investment cost and operational cost of a combined heat and power production plant using biomass as feedstock.

## Usage

The usage of the package is best illustrated through the commented [`examples`](examples).
The examples are minimum working examples highlighting how to build simple energy system models.

## Project Funding

The development of `EnergyModelsHeat` was funded by the Norwegian Research Council in the project [ZEESA](https://www.sintef.no/en/projects/2023/zeesa-zero-emission-energy-systems-for-the-arctic/), project number [336342](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/336342), as well as the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme in the project [iDesignRES](https://idesignres.eu/) under grant agreement [101095849](https://doi.org/10.3030/101095849).
