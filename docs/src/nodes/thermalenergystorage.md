# [ThermalEnergyStorage](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage)

[`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref)functions mostly like a RefStorage with the additional option to include thermal energy losses.

## [Introduced type and its fields](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage-fields)

[`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) is implemented as equivalent to a [`RefStorage`](@extref EnergyModelsBase.RefStorage).
Hence, it utilizes the same functions declared in `EnergyModelsBase`. For the [`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) node, heat losses are additionally quantified through a heat loss factor that describes the amount of thermal energy that is lost in relation to the storage level of the respective timeperiod. The main difference to RefStorage is that these heat losses occur independently of the storage use, i.e. in every operational period unless the storage level is zero.  

!!!This node is currently only available with the StorageBehaviour CyclicPeriods!!!

The fields of a [`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) are given as:

- **`id`** :\
     The field `id` is only used for providing a name to the storage.
- **`charge::AbstractStorageParameters`** :\
    The charging parameters of the ThermalEnergyStorage. Depending on the chosen type, the charge parameters can include variable OPEX, fixed OPEX,
  and/or a capacity.
- **`level::AbstractStorageParameters`** :\
    The level parameters of the ThermalEnergyStorage. Depending on the chosen type, the charge parameters can include variable OPEX and/or fixed OPEX.
- **`stor_res::Resource`** :\
    The stored ThermalEnergyStorage.
- **`heatlossfactor::Float64`** :\
    The relative heat losses in percent. 
- **`input::Dict{<:Resource,<:Real}`** :\
    The input Resources with conversion
  value `Real`.
- **`output::Dict{<:Resource,<:Real}`** :\
    The generated Resources with conversion  value `Real`. Only relevant for linking and the stored Resources as the output
  value is not utilized in the calculations.
- **`data::Vector{<:Data}`** :\
    The additional data (*e.g.*, for investments). The field `data` is conditional through usage of a constructor.

## [Mathematical description](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage-math)

### [Variables](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage-math-var)

The [`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) utilizes all standard variables from [`RefStorage`](@extref EnergyModelsBase.RefStorage), as described on the page *[Optimization variables](@extref EnergyModelsBase man-opt_var)*:

- [``\texttt{opex\_var}``](@extref man-opt_var-opex)
- [``\texttt{opex\_fixed}``](@extref man-opt_var-opex)
- [``\texttt{stor\_level}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap)
- [``\texttt{stor\_level\_inst}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap) if the `ThermalEnergyStorage` has the field `charge` with a capacity
- [``\texttt{stor\_charge\_use}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap)
- [``\texttt{stor\_charge\_inst}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap)
- [``\texttt{stor\_discharge\_inst}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap) if the `ThermalEnergyStorage` has the field `discharge` with a capacity
- [``\texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap)
- [``\texttt{flow\_in}``](@extref man-opt_var-flow)
- [``\texttt{flow\_out}``](@extref man-opt_var-flow)
- [``\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap)
- [``\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}``](@extref man-opt_var-cap) if the `TimeStruct` includes `RepresentativePeriods`
- [``\texttt{emissions\_node}``](@extref man-opt_var-emissions) if specified through the function [`has_emissions`](@extref EnergyModelsBase.has_emissions-Tuple{EnergyModelsBase.Node})

### [Constraints](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage-math-con)

[`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) nodes utilize in general the standard constraints described in *[Constraint functions for `Storage` nodes](@extref EnergyModelsBase nodes-storage-math-con)*. 
[`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) nodes utilize the declared method for all nodes 搨ｩ.
The constraint functions are called within the function [`create_node`](@ref).
Hence, if you do not have to call additional functions, but only plan to include a method for one of the existing functions, you do not have to specify a new [`create_node`](@ref) method. The following standard constraints are implemented for a [`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) node.

- `constraints_capacity`:

  ```math
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{stor\_level\_use}[n, t] & = \texttt{stor\_level\_inst}[n, t] \\
  \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t] & = \texttt{stor\_charge\_inst}[n, t] \\
  \texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}[n, t] & = \texttt{stor\_discharge\_inst}[n, t]
  \end{aligned}
  ```

- `constraints_capacity_installed`:

  ```math
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{stor\_level\_inst}[n, t] & = capacity(level(n), t) \\
  \texttt{stor\_charge\_inst}[n, t] & = capacity(charge(n), t) \\
  \texttt{stor\_discharge\_inst}[n, t] & = capacity(discharge(n), t)
  \end{aligned}
  ```

  !!! tip "Using investments"
      The function `constraints_capacity_installed` is also used in [`EnergyModelsInvestments`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsInvestments.jl/) to incorporate the potential for investment.
      Nodes with investments are then no longer constrained by the parameter capacity.

- `constraints_flow_in`:\
  The auxiliary resource constraints are independent of the chosen storage behavior:

  ```math
  \texttt{flow\_in}[n, t, p] = inputs(n, p) \times \texttt{flow\_in}[n, stor\_res(n)]
  \qquad \forall p \in inputs(n) \setminus \{stor\_res(n)\}
  ```

  The stored resource constraints are depending on the chosen storage behavior.
  If no behavior is specified, it is given by

  ```math
  \texttt{flow\_in}[n, t, stor\_res(n)] = \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t]
  ```

  If the storage behavior is [`AccumulatingEmissions`](@ref), it is given by

  ```math
  \texttt{flow\_in}[n, t, stor\_res(n)] = \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t] - \texttt{emissions\_node}[n, t, stor\_res(n)]
  ```

  This allows the storage node to provide a soft constraint for emissions.

- `constraints_flow_out`:

  ```math
  \texttt{flow\_out}[n, t, stor\_res(n)] = \texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}[n, t]
  ```

  !!! tip "Behavior in the case of `AccumulatingEmissions`"
      In this case, the constraints are still declared.
      The variables are however fixed to 0.
      Hence, it will have no impact.

- `constraints_level`:\
  The level constraints are more complex compared to the standard constraints.
  They are explained in detail below in *[Level constraints](@ref nodes-storage-math-con-level)*.

- `constraints_opex_fixed`:

  ```math
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{opex\_fixed}&[n, t_{inv}] = \\ &
    opex\_fixed(level(n), t_{inv}) \times \texttt{stor\_level\_inst}[n, first(t_{inv})] + \\ &
    opex\_fixed(charge(n), t_{inv}) \times \texttt{stor\_charge\_inst}[n, first(t_{inv})] + \\ &
    opex\_fixed(discharge(n), t_{inv}) \times \texttt{stor\_discharge\_inst}[n, first(t_{inv})]
  \end{aligned}
  ```

  !!! tip "Why do we use `first()`"
      The variables ``\texttt{stor\_level\_inst}`` are declared over all operational periods (see the section on *[Capacity variables](@ref man-opt_var-cap)* for further explanations).
      Hence, we use the function ``first(t_{inv})`` to retrieve the installed capacities in the first operational period of a given strategic period ``t_{inv}`` in the function `constraints_opex_fixed`.

- `constraints_opex_var`:

  ```math
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{opex\_var}&[n, t_{inv}] = \\ \sum_{t \in t_{inv}}&
    opex\_var(level(n), t) \times \texttt{stor\_level}[n, t] \times scale\_op\_sp(t_{inv}, t) + \\ &
    opex\_var(charge(n), t) \times \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t] \times scale\_op\_sp(t_{inv}, t) + \\ &
    opex\_var(discharge(n), t) \times \texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}[n, t] \times scale\_op\_sp(t_{inv}, t)
  \end{aligned}
  ```

  !!! tip "The function `scale_op_sp`"
      The function [``scale\_op\_sp(t_{inv}, t)``](@ref scale_op_sp) calculates the scaling factor between operational and strategic periods.
      It also takes into account potential operational scenarios and their probability as well as representative periods.

- `constraints_data`:\
  This function is only called for specified data of the storage node, see above.

!!! info "Implementation of capacity and OPEX"
    The capacity constraints, both `constraints_capacity` and `constraints_capacity_installed` are only set for capacities that are included through the corresponding field and if the corresponding *[storage parameters](@ref lib-pub-nodes-stor_par)* have a field `capacity`.
    Otherwise, they are omitted.
    The field `level` is required to have a storage parameter with capacity.

    Even if a `Storage` node includes the corresponding capacity field (*i.e.*, `charge`, `level`, and `discharge`), we only include the fixed and variable OPEX constribution for the different capacities if the corresponding *[storage parameters](@ref lib-pub-nodes-stor_par)* have a field `opex_fixed` and `opex_var`, respectively.
    Otherwise, they are omitted.

#### [Level constraints](@id nodes-ThermalEnergyStorage-math-con-level)

The overall structure is outlined on *[Constraint functions](@ref man-con-stor_level)*.
The level constraints are called through the function `constraints_level` which then calls additional functions depending on the chosen time structure (whether it includes representative periods and/or operational scenarios) and the chosen *[storage behaviour](@ref lib-pub-nodes-stor_behav)*. Note: [`ThermalEnergyStorage`](@ref) only makes changes to the `constraint_level_iterate`function when [`CyclicStrategic`](@ref) is chosen as storage behaviour. 

The constraints introduced in `constraints_level_aux` are given by

```math
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, t] = \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t] - \texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}[n, t]
```

corresponding to the change in the storage level in an operational period.
If the storage behavior is [`AccumulatingEmissions`](@ref), it is instead given by

```math
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, t] = \texttt{stor\_charge\_use}[n, t]
```

In this case, we also fix variables and provide lower bounds:

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \texttt{emissions\_node}[n, t, stor\_res(n)] \geq 0 \\
& \texttt{emissions\_node}[n, t, p_{em}] = 0 \qquad & \forall p_{em} \in P^{em} \setminus \{stor\_res(n)\} \\
& \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, t] \geq 0 \\
& \texttt{stor\_discharge\_use}[n, t] = 0 \\
& \texttt{flow\_out}[n, t, p] = 0 \qquad & \forall p \in output(n)
\end{aligned}
```

If the time structure includes representative periods, we calculate the change of the storage level in each representative period within the function `constraints_level_iterate`:

```math
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}[n, t_{rp}] = \sum_{t \in t_{rp}}
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, t] \times scale_op_sp(t_{rp}, t)
```

In the case of [`CyclicStrategic`](@ref), we add an additional constraint to the change in the function `constraints_level_rp`:

```math
\sum_{t_{rp} \in T^{rp}} \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}[n, t_{rp}] = 0
```

while we fix the value in the case of [`CyclicRepresentative`](@ref) to 0:

```math
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}[n, t_{rp}] = 0
```

`Accumulating` storage behaviors do not add any constraint for the variable ``\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}``.

If the time structure includes operational scenarios using [`CyclicRepresentative`](@ref), we enforce that the last value in each operational scenario is the same within the function `constraints_level_scp`.

The general level constraint is eventually calculated in the function `constraints_level_iterate`:

```math
\texttt{stor\_level}[n, t] = prev\_level +
\texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, t] \times duration(t) -
prev\_level \times heatlossfactor(n)
```

in which the value ``prev\_level`` is depending on the type of the previous operational (``t_{prev}``) and strategic level (``t_{inv,prev}``) (as well as the previous representative period (``t_{rp,prev}``)).
It is calculated through the function `previous_level`.

We can distinguish the following cases:

1. The first operational period (in the first representative period) in a strategic period (given by ``typeof(t_{prev}) = typeof(t_{rp, prev}) = = nothing``).
   In this situation, the previous level is dependent on the chosen storage behavior.
   In the default case of a [`Cyclic`](@ref) behaviors, it is given by the last operational period of either the strategic or representative period:

   ```math
   \begin{aligned}
     prev\_level & = \texttt{stor\_level}[n, last(t_{sp})]
     prev\_level & = \texttt{stor\_level}[n, last(t_{rp})]
   \end{aligned}
   ```

   If the storage behavior is instead given by [`CyclicStrategic`](@ref) and the time structure includes representative periods, we calculate the previous level instead as:

   ```math
   \begin{aligned}
   t_{rp,last}  = & last(repr\_periods(t_{sp})) \\
   prev\_level = & \texttt{stor\_level}[n, first(t_{rp,last})] - \\ &
     \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, first(t_{rp,last})] \times duration(first(t_{rp,last})) + \\ &
     \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}[n, t_{rp,last}]
   \end{aligned}
   ```

   ``t_{rp,last}`` corresponds in this situation to the last representative period in the current strategic period.

   If the storage behavior is instead given by [`CyclicStrategic`](@ref), the previous level is set to 0:

   ```math
   prev\_level = 0
   ```

2. The first operational period in subsequent representative periods in any strategic period (given by ``typeof(t_{prev}) = nothing``).
   The previous level is again dependent on the chosen storage behavior.
   The default approach calculates it as:

   ```math
   \begin{aligned}
    prev\_level = & \texttt{stor\_level}[n, first(t_{rp,prev})] - \\ &
      \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_op}[n, first(t_{rp,prev})] \times duration(first(t_{rp,prev})) + \\ &
      \texttt{stor\_level\_ﾎ能_rp}[n, t_{rp,prev}]
   \end{aligned}
   ```

   while a [`CyclicRepresentative`](@ref) storage behavior calculates it as:

   ```math
   prev\_level = \texttt{stor\_level}[n, last(t_{rp})]
   ```

   This situation only occurs in cases in which the time structure includes representative periods.

3. All other operational periods:\

   ```math
    prev\_level = \texttt{stor\_level}[n, t_{prev}]
   ```
